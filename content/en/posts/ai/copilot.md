# How to Use Copilot

Developed by GitHub, Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you write code faster and more efficiently. In this article, we will discuss how to use Copilot and some useful shortcuts it provides.

## Quickstart

To get started with Copilot, you can refer to the official quickstart documentation provided by GitHub: [Copilot Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/zh/copilot/quickstart).

## Shortcuts

Copilot offers several handy shortcuts that allow you to use it more efficiently. Here are some of the commonly used shortcuts:

- **Accept a suggestion:** Tab
- **Reject a suggestion:** Esc
- **Open Copilot panel:** Ctrl + Enter (This will open a separate panel displaying 10 suggestions)
- **Next suggestion:** Alt/Option + ]
- **Previous suggestion:** Alt/Option + [
- **Trigger inline Copilot:** Alt/Option + \ (Use this shortcut to manually trigger Copilot for suggestions when it hasn't provided any or when suggestions have been rejected)

## Idea Authentication

If you want to authenticate Idea (IntelliJ IDEA) with Copilot, you can follow these steps:

1. If you have already authenticated vscode, make sure it is open.
2. Download the Copilot plugin for IntelliJ IDEA and restart the IDE.
3. In the bottom right corner, you will see a prompt asking you to log in. Click on it.
4. You will be redirected to GitHub, where you will see an 8-digit verification code input box.
5. Simply paste the code (the password will be automatically copied from vscode).

For more detailed information on idea authentication with Copilot, you can refer to the following GitHub discussion thread: [Idea Authentication with Copilot](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/8468#discussioncomment-4818526).

By following these steps, you will be able to use Copilot seamlessly with Idea and enhance your coding experience.

Remember, Copilot is here to assist you, but it's still important to carefully review and validate its suggestions to ensure the quality and accuracy of your code.
