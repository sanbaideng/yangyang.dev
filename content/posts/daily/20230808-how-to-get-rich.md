# @naval : How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)
https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936

* Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.寻求财富，而不是金钱或地位。财富是你在睡觉时还能赚钱的资产。金钱是我们转移时间和财富的方式。地位是你在社会阶层中的位置。
* Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. 明白道德的财富创造是可能的。如果你暗地里鄙视财富，它会避开你。
* Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. 忽视那些玩地位游戏的人。他们通过攻击玩财富创造游戏的人来提升地位。🎮
* You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom. 你不会通过租用你的时间变富。你必须拥有权益 - 一部分企业 - 来获得你的财务自由。⏳
* You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. 你会通过给社会提供它想要但还不知道如何得到的东西而变富。并且要大规模地做。🌐
* Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people. 选择一个你能和长期的人玩长期游戏的行业。
* The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven't figured this out yet. 互联网大大扩大了职业的可能空间。大多数人还没弄明白这一点。
* Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. 玩迭代游戏。生活中的所有回报，无论是财富、关系还是知识，都来自复利。🔄
* Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. 选择智力、精力高，尤其是诚信的商业伙伴。🤝
* Don't partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. 不要和愤世嫉俗者、悲观者合作。他们的信念是自我实现的。🚫
* Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable. 学会销售。学会建设。如果你能做到这两点，你将无人能挡。
* Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. 用专业知识、责任心和杠杆武装自己。🛠️
* Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. 专业知识是你无法被训练的知识。如果社会能训练你，它就能训练其他人，并取代你。
* Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. 专业知识是通过追求你真正的好奇心和激情，而不是现在流行的东西来找到的。
* Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. 建立专业知识对你来说会感觉像玩耍，但对他人来说看起来像工作。
* When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. 当专业知识被教授时，它是通过学徒制，而不是学校。
* Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated. 专业知识通常是高度技术性的或创造
* Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. 拥抱责任，并以自己的名义承担商业风险。社会会以责任、权益和杠杆作为你的回报。👥
* The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon. 最有责任感的人拥有独特、公开且有风险的品牌：如奥普拉、特朗普、坎耶、马斯克。
* “Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” - Archimedes “给我一个足够长的杠杆，和一个立足之地，我就能移动地球。” - 阿基米德 🌍
* Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media). 财富需要杠杆。商业杠杆来自资本、人力和没有边际复制成本的产品（代码和媒体）。
* Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment. 资本意味着金钱。要筹集资金，应用你的特定知识，承担责任，并展现出良好的判断力。💵
* Labor means people working for you. It's the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. 劳动意味着为你工作的人。这是最古老且最被争夺的杠杆形式。劳动杠杆会让你的父母感到印象深刻，但不要浪费你的生命去追求它。‍‍‍
* Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you. 资本和劳动是有许可的杠杆。每个人都在追逐资本，但必须有人给你。每个人都试图领导，但必须有人跟随你。
* Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep. 代码和媒体是无需许可的杠杆。这是新富人背后的杠杆。你可以创建在你睡觉时为你工作的软件和媒体。
* An army of robots is freely available - it's just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it. 一个机器人军队是免费可用的 - 它只是为了热效率和空间效率被打包在数据中心里。使用它。🤖
* If you can't code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts. 如果你不会编码，写书和博客，录制视频和播客。📚
* Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement. 杠杆是你判断力的力量倍增器。⚖️
* Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills. 判断力需要经验，但通过学习基础技能可以更快地建立。🧠
* There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes. 没有所谓的“商业”技能。避免阅读商业杂志和参加商业课程。
