gpt summary:
Code review is an important part of an engineer's job at Tumblr. The codebases at Tumblr are shared by many engineers, so it is crucial to ensure that the code is not only well-written, but also understandable by others. When reviewing code, it is important to consider the author's experience level and provide appropriate feedback. It is also important to review the code with the perspective of someone who is unfamiliar with the codebase, as well as with the future in mind, as someone may need to understand the code in the future. Additionally, it is important to understand the scope of the code change and stay on top of the review process to provide timely feedback. Finally, it is important to remember to be kind and understanding when reviewing code, as everyone makes mistakes and codebases can be complex.
